# About Me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArnauQuintana, a passionate **Electronics Engineer** with a strong background in **Embedded Systems** and **Power Electronics**. I hold a **Masterâ€™s degree in Electronic and Communications Engineering** from **FH Joanneum**, where I gained solid expertise in designing and developing both hardware and software systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in a confidential project developing the firmware for a 1 MW inverter. 
## What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Firmware Development**: Working with embedded systems, specifically with **C2000** and **MSP** family from TI and **STM32** family from ST.
- **Power Electronics**: Designing and optimizing power conversion systems, including **Hardware** and **Software**.
- **Control Systems**: Developing control algorithms. 

## My Skills
- **Embedded C Programming**
- **Real-Time Systems** and **Firmware Development**
- **Simulation Software**: MATLAB/Simulink, LTSpice, etc.
- **Hardware**: Power electronics circuits, PCB design, and hardware debugging.
- **Control Systems**: Developing algorithms for motor control, power electronics, and system optimization.

## Why I Love What I Do

Iâ€™m deeply interested in the intersection of hardware and software, especially when it comes to designing systems that efficiently solve real-world problems. My passion lies in **innovating within the fields of power electronics and embedded systems**, and I am always looking to learn more and push the boundaries of what is possible.
